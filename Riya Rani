Commercial real estate (CRE) refers to properties used for business or income generation. These include:

Office buildings: Spaces for companies.
Retail spaces: Shops, malls, and storefronts.
Warehouses: Storage or logistics hubs.
Hotels: Short-term lodging properties.
Industrial facilities: Manufacturing units.
Example: Owning a retail space in a busy shopping district can provide steady rental income while increasing in value as the area develops.
